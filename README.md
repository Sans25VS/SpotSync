Code Overview
Server (server.js)
The server uses Express to serve static files and Socket.io for real-time communication. It listens for location updates from clients and broadcasts these updates to all connected clients.

Client (public/js/scripts.js)
The client script handles getting the device's location and sending it to the server via WebSockets. It also listens for location updates from the server and updates the map accordingly.

Dependencies
express
socket.io
ejs
nodemon
leaflet
